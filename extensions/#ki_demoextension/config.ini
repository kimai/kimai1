; you may set this to an empty string if you don't want a function called up on tabchange
; multiple calls can be added using ";" as delimiter *inside* the quotes

; Hooklist:
; TAB_CHANGE_TRIGGER       - gets called when any tab was clicked, regardless if the tab is already active or not
; TIMEFRAME_CHANGE_TRIGGER - gets called everytime the datepicker picks a date (equally for start and end)
; BUZZER_RECORD_TRIGGER    - fires when the buzzer was clicked for recording (also true for "record again" in ts_ext)
; BUZZER_STOP_TRIGGER      - fires when the buzzer was hit in stop-state (true for stops in ts_ext)
; CHANGE_CUSTOMER_TRIGGER       - gets called when any change happend on a customer record
; CHANGE_PROJECT_TRIGGER       - same for projects
; CHANGE_ACTIVITY_TRIGGER       - same for activities
; REG_TIMEOUTS             - if you have timeouts running that do not need to run when the tab of your extension
;                            is not active, register them here. they will be terminated on tabchange and you have
;                            to restart them on triggerchange
 
; If you need a special hook for your extension please contact the core-team ;)
