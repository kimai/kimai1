Installation:
-------------

# Use a *modern* Browser!
# You need PHP 5 and access to a MySQL-database.
# Start your Browser and go to your Kimai directory.
# Since 0.8 Kimai has a step-by-step installation program. 
  Just follow the instructions of the installer.

IMPORTANT! Remove the 'installer' directory when youâ€™ve successfully
installed Kimai.

  ***********************************************
  * You can login via the preinstalled account: *
  * User: admin / Password: changeme            *
  ***********************************************

When Kimai doesn't start the reason is probably wrong writing permissions
of certain files and folders! The installer shows you which permissions
are to be set.

If you have problems installing, please read the section 'Support'
in the forum. -> http://forum.kimai.org

A new version updates the database automatically (is nessesary).
Before that a backup of your data will be created. Normally you'll
not even notice this process. If anything goes wrong during the
database-update you can recover the data via phpMyAdmin (we're
also working on a tool for recoverage...)


Updates:
--------

YOU CAN ONLY UPDATE VERSIONS HIGHER THAN 7.0!


To install a new version just replace the entire directory with the new
package EXCEPT the file 'autoconf.php' which sits inside the 'includes' folder.

Additionally you have to make sure the permissions are still correct. The following
folders and files need to be writeable for the webserver:
/compile
/extensions/ki_timesheets/compile
/extensions/ki_adminpanel/compile
/extensions/ki_expenses/compile
/extensions/ki_export/compile
/extensions/ki_budget/compile
/extensions/ki_invoice/compile
/temporary
/temporary/logfile.txt
/includes/autoconf.php


Once again: Kimai will NOT work with wrong writing permissions!


=== Update when no autoconf.php exists ===

If you already have a autoconf.php in your installation skip this.

Rename your conf.php file to autoconf.php.

Then edit it and add three new variables:

$server_type = 'mysql';	  // the database type (needed for PDO) usually 'mysql'
						  // check the PHP PDO manual if you are using a different
						  // database
$server_conn = "mysql";

$password_salt   = "";

Kimai will then work in non-PDO mode. If you want to
use PDO $server_conn must be set to "pdo".



Finally visit your Kimai installation with your web browser and the
auto update process will perform all further necessary updates.


Some final words:
-----------------

This software is free of charge. We ask you to NOT remove the copyright-notes
on the login-panel and in the credits-window.



Have Fun!
