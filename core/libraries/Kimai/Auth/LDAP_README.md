# Advanced LDAP-Authentication

## Usage

To use the advanced LDAP-Authentication in kimai you will have to do one of the following:

 * create a new class "Kimai_Auth_Yourname" (where "yourname has to be lowercase ecept for the first character) that extends Kiami_Auth_Ldapadvanced and overwrite the properties of Kimai_Auth_Ldapadvanced with your data or
 * Simply configure the stuff in the Kimai_Auth_Ldapadvanced class by overwriting the defaults for the properties

Then you will have to add the following line to your ```includes/autofonf.php```-file:

    $authenticator = 'yourname';

*yourname* is the last part of the classname, this time completely in lowercase. If you overwrote the properties from Kimai_Auth_Ldapadvanced it is simply ```ldapadvanced```
