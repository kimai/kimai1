Kimai Time Tracking
===================

This is the repository of Kimai, a open source time tracking software
that runs on (almost) every webserver with PHP and MySQL.

You can get more information about this Time Tracking Software:

* at our [official website](http://www.kimai.org)
* at our [Kimai forum](http://forum.kimai.org)

We don't have much documentation, but what we have can be found at:
* [http://www.kimai.org/documentation/](http://www.kimai.org/documentation/)

Contributing
------------

We would love to get input from all developer out there:

1. Fork Kimai or one of its [other repos][1]
2. Create a branch (`git checkout -b my_kimai`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am "Added foobar"`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my_kimai`)
5. Create an [Pull Request][2] with a link to your branch

Here are a few rules to follow in order to ease code reviews, and discussions before maintainers accept and merge your work:

* You SHOULD write documentation.
* Please, write commit messages that make sense, and rebase your branch before submitting your Pull Request.
* One may ask you to squash your commits too. This is used to "clean" your Pull Request before merging it (we don't want commits such as fix tests, fix 2, fix 3, etc.).
* When creating your Pull Request on GitHub, you MUST write a description which gives the context and/or explains why you are creating it.
